An algorithm visualizer is a tool or software application that helps users understand how algorithms work by providing a visual representation of their execution. It allows users to step through the different stages of an algorithm's operation, visually observing how data is processed and manipulated at each step.

Here's a breakdown of key features and aspects commonly found in algorithm visualizers:

Visualization Interface: Typically, there's a graphical user interface (GUI) where users can input data or select pre-defined datasets and choose an algorithm to visualize. The visualization is often represented through animations, graphs, or diagrams.

Algorithm Selection: Users can choose from a variety of algorithms such as sorting algorithms (like bubble sort, quicksort, merge sort), pathfinding algorithms (like Dijkstra's algorithm, A*), searching algorithms (like binary search), and more.

Step-by-Step Execution: The visualizer demonstrates the execution of the chosen algorithm step by step. It highlights the specific operations being performed on the data and how it changes with each iteration or recursive call.

Speed Control: Users can often control the speed of the visualization, allowing them to observe the algorithm's behavior in slow motion or real-time, aiding better understanding.

Data Representation: Algorithms often operate on data structures like arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, etc. Visualizers represent these data structures visually, making it easier for users to follow how the algorithm interacts with them.

Interactive Elements: Some visualizers offer interactive elements where users can pause, rewind, or manually step through the algorithm's execution. This interactivity can enhance the learning experience.

Educational Tool: Algorithm visualizers are commonly used in educational settings to help students and enthusiasts comprehend the inner workings of algorithms. They can also serve as teaching aids for educators.

Debugging and Understanding: They are valuable for debugging algorithms or understanding complex algorithms by visualizing their behavior and pinpointing potential issues.
